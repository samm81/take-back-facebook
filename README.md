### Reclaim Facebook as a tool - not an addiction

TBF is a Google Chrome extension that tries to undo all the little visual and UI tricks that Facebook plays on you. Facebook has become a huge time waste for many people because they employ a variety of addictive tricks to keep you coming back. This extension tries to mitigate the addictive aspects to allow you to have the control of when to use Facebook - or not to.

TBF...
* makes notifications gray
  * red notifications create a sense of urgency that encourage interaction even when you might have come to Facebook for some other reason
* prevents number of unread notifications in tab name
  * seeing number of unread notifications while in another tab trying to focus is very distracting
* prevents tab name from changing when a user messages you
  * similarily distracting
* gets rid of pop-ups on the bottom left and on the top right
  * popups are an unecessary call to action to try and get you to engage more - the notification bar takes care of informing you that something has changed
* makes the whole title bar gray
  * Facebook's blue is a very carefully handpicked shade, designed to engage users further
* gets rid of trending topics
* gets rid of game ads
* and more!
