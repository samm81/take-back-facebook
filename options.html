					"A friend at Facebook told Harris that designers initially decided the notification icon, which alerts people to new activity such as 'friend requests' or 'likes', should be blue. It fit Facebook's style and, the thinking went, would appear 'subtle and innocuous'. 'But no one used it,' Harris says. 'Then they switched it to red and of course everyone used it.'" - <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/oct/05/smartphone-addiction-silicon-valley-dystopia">source</a>

					This prevents the title from showing your notification count, and informing you of a new message.

					Notifications are a great example of a Skinner box, also known as a slot machine. Every notification can either be great (your crush Sally like your profile picture), devastating (your annoying Aunt Shelly commented on your vacation photos), or middle of the road (your friend Kyle liked your post). By broadcasting the number of unread notifications you have in the status bar, Facebook is inviting you back to play the slot machine. Skinner boxes and slot machines alike are well known to be highly addictive, and Facebook employs this psychology to keep you coming back.

					When you receive a message Facebook swaps the title every few seconds. This is in order to continually draw your attention to the message. Motion is well known to draw a person's focus. By placing motion in the tab bar, Facebook is trying to draw you back into Facebook despite the fact that you had the best intentions to focus on another tab.

				Motion draws attention, so a notification that pops into your field of view while using the site affords you little choice but to examine it. This subverts your ability to chose for yourself when you are going to interact with the site - instead of being able to deal with a notification at a later point in time, you are heavily encouraged to deal with it <b>now</b>.
