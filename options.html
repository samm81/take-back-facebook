					"A friend at Facebook told Harris that designers initially decided the notification icon, which alerts people to new activity such as 'friend requests' or 'likes', should be blue. It fit Facebook's style and, the thinking went, would appear 'subtle and innocuous'. 'But no one used it,' Harris says. 'Then they switched it to red and of course everyone used it.'" - <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/oct/05/smartphone-addiction-silicon-valley-dystopia">source</a>

				Although it's well understood that certain colors can have certain psychological profiles, there has not been publicly accessible research conducted into the specific choice of blue that Facebook has adopted as it's primary color. However, it's well know that Silicon Valley has a habit of A/B testing a wide variety of user interface choices, including color. An A/B test is a method through which Facebook attempts to sniff out which user interface tweaks will best drive their metrics. In the case of color, they do this by displaying Facebook colored in a particular shade of blue to one set of users, and Facebook colored a slightly different shade of blue to another set. Over many millions of interactions, Facebook can determine which shade of blue makes you ever so slightly more likely to interact with the site. Our logic behind the removal is simple: we know that the metrics Facebook is trying to drive are bad for the end user, and Facebook is choosing the best color to drive metrics, so we know this color is probably not helping the end user.

					This prevents the title from showing your notification count, and informing you of a new message.

					Notifications are a great example of a Skinner box, also known as a slot machine. Every notification can either be great (your crush Sally like your profile picture), devastating (your annoying Aunt Shelly commented on your vacation photos), or middle of the road (your friend Kyle liked your post). By broadcasting the number of unread notifications you have in the status bar, Facebook is inviting you back to play the slot machine. Skinner boxes and slot machines alike are well known to be highly addictive, and Facebook employs this psychology to keep you coming back.

					When you receive a message Facebook swaps the title every few seconds. This is in order to continually draw your attention to the message. Motion is well known to draw a person's focus. By placing motion in the tab bar, Facebook is trying to draw you back into Facebook despite the fact that you had the best intentions to focus on another tab.

				Motion draws attention, so a notification that pops into your field of view while using the site affords you little choice but to examine it. This subverts your ability to chose for yourself when you are going to interact with the site - instead of being able to deal with a notification at a later point in time, you are heavily encouraged to deal with it <b>now</b>.
